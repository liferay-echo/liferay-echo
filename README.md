### Hey, this is the github user from the ECHO Team ðŸ‘‹

If you want to send changes in some of our components, please 
send it to the [liferay-echo/liferay-portal repository][1] to be reviewed. In case
you are not sure if the component belongs to us, please [check the Echo components document][2].

The more information you provide about the pull request, the better it will be for us to review and
forward it as soon as possible. Please, take the time to ensure it adheres to the [Echo Pull Request Template](https://gist.github.com/liferay-echo/5a4455285ff1800f9da146816d85e67d#file-pull-request-template-md).

Once the pull request has been sent, we track the progress of it using GitHub
labels (for example, if the PR needs some frontend review we add the
"Frontend Review Needed"). Here is a list of
[all the different labels that we use][3].
