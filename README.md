### Hey, this is the github user from the ECHO Team 👋

If you want to send changes in some of our components, please 
send it to the [liferay-echo/liferay-portal repository][1] to be reviewed. In case
you are not sure if the component belongs to us, please [check the Echo components document][2].

The more information you provide about the pull request, the better it will be for us to review and
forward it as soon as possible. So taking some time adding information about the
changes you made in the PR or linking the associated JIRA ticket is advised.

Once the pull request has been sent, we track the progress of it using GitHub
labels (for example, if the PP needs some frontend review we add the
"Frontend Review Needed"). Here is a list of
[all the different labels that we use][3].

The members of the team that manage the repo, are, separated by area of
knowledge:
- Backend: [@ealonso][5], [@jkappler][5], [@ruben-pulido][6]
- Frontend: [@p2kmgcl][8], [@sandrodw3][9], [@veroglez][10], [@victorg1991][11].
- QA: [@david-gutierrez-mesa][12], [@liulukiwi][13], [@tim-cao][14].
